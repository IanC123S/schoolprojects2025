# schoolprojects2025
## Main repository for my school projects using the Love2D framework.
All files have a packaged folder, which you can download for the packaged files. The source code used in the exe is obviously not in the packaged folder, but is in the main directory (for example, flappy birb has the source code in the schoolprojects2025/flappybirb directory, while the packaged version is in the schoolprojects2025/flappybirb/packaged directory)
