# schoolprojects2025
## Main repository for my school projects using the Love2D framework.
### (More) Information
This is the repository for my school projects as of 2025. All of these use Love2D as the framework, which uses Lua as the programming language. I am still figuring out how to use GitHub and how Love2d works, so things may not be perfect.
### Installation
Install the packaged folder only if you want the packaged files to be easily run on your computer. For example, the packaged version of Flappy Bird's source code is in the **schoolprojects2025/flappybirb/packaged** folder.
